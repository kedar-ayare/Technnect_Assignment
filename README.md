2. Home Screen - Basic summary of user
3. BankDets Screen - Can be used to show more details to user. Can be visited be tapping on "Your Budget" Panel on Home Screen.
4. Used [Random Number API](https://www.randomnumberapi.com/) to get a random number to be displayed as total balance on Home Screen
5. Projects also has 2 other component files.

## Places where there could have been improvemts:
1. In Home Screen, I tried adding an actual graph in "Top Expenses" Panel, but faced some issues that I was unable to solve.
2. Tried to do Application level caching as instructed, by using AsyncStorage, but encountered some bugs that wasn't able to solve.
